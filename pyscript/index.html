            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>The Australian Tax Office (ATO) allows you to <a
                    href="https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/income-deductions-offsets-and-records/deductions-you-can-claim/working-from-home-expenses/fixed-rate-method">claim
                    a deduction for work from home (WFH) expenses,
                    using a fixed-rate deduction method</a>. This method requires that you keep a record of those work
                hours. One way to do that is with a separate Google Calendar, added to an existing account. This tool helps you analyse your work from home hours based on entries in such a calendar.
            </p>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Set up a dedicated "WFH" calendar in Google Calendar</h3>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>First, ideally at the start of a tax year, set up a dedicated calendar in your Google Calendar account to use for tracking
                        work from home hours. Click the <mark>+</mark> icon next to <mark>Other calendars</mark> and select <mark>Create new calendar</mark>.</p>
                    <p>It's recommended to create recurring events for your known work from home days ahead of time. Then you can add/delete/edit
                        individual entries throughout the year to reflect the actual hours worked from home. This will help you maintain an accurate record.</p>
                    <p>If you need to you can cross-check your WFH calendar with information in your main work calendar or other records of holidays, leave, etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>Important</strong>: All entries in the WFH calendar are counted as work from home hours. This calendar should not
                        contain any other events.</p>

            <h3>Analyse your WFH Google Calendar</h3>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>At tax time, export your WFH calendar and upload it here for analysis...</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open Google Calendar.</li>
                        <li>Click on the three dots next to your WFH calendar.</li>
                        <li>Select <mark>Settings and sharing</mark> from the dropdown menu.</li>
                        <li>Find and click the <mark>Export calendar</mark> option.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Upload the exported file below, then select the financial year of interest. If all goes well you should see a summary of hours.</p>

            <h2>How it works / privacy</h2>
            <p>This tool uses PyScript to run a small Python program (~50 lines) in your browser. The code uses the <a

                library to read calendar entries, then calculates the total hours worked from home.</p>
                <p>All analysis is done locally in your browser, and no personal data is sent to any server. Your privacy is
                    respected.</p>
